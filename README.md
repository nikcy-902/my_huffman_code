**Project Overview**
The Huffman coding is a well-known method of data compression that minimises the overall amount of bits needed to encode a collection of characters. The point is to use shorter binary codes in more frequent characters and longer ones in less frequent ones in such a way that the encoding is prefix-free (no code is a prefix of another). This project illustrates the application of Huffman coding in C++ in order to produce the most optimal binary codes to represent any character set and frequency.

**Step 1: Preparing the Data**

The program begins by taking a string of distinct characters and an array of their corresponding frequencies. For example, letters = "abcdef" and freqArr = {5, 9, 12, 13, 16, 45}. Each character is stored in a node structure along with its frequency. These nodes are then inserted into a priority queue (min-heap) so that the nodes with the smallest frequencies are always accessed first. This ensures that the algorithm can efficiently pick the two least frequent nodes to merge at each step.

**Step 2: Building the Huffman Tree**

The Huffman tree is constructed iteratively. At each step, the two nodes with the lowest frequencies are removed from the priority queue. A new parent node is created whose frequency is the sum of the two nodes, and the two nodes are set as its left and right children. This new node is then pushed back into the priority queue. This process continues until there is only one node left in the queue, which becomes the root of the Huffman tree. The tree structure guarantees that characters with higher frequencies will be closer to the root, resulting in shorter codes.

**Step 3: Generating Huffman Codes**

After the tree is constructed, the program generates Huffman codes using a recursive traversal of the tree. Starting from the root, moving to the left child appends a ‘0’ to the current code, while moving to the right child appends a ‘1’. When a leaf node is reached (which contains an actual character), the current binary sequence is stored as that character’s Huffman code. This ensures that each character gets a unique, prefix-free code according to its frequency.
Step 4 Preorder Traversal and Output.
After the codes are generated, they are printed in preorder traversal sequence i.e. the root is first processed then the left subtree followed by the right subtree. Such traversal makes sure that the codes are presented in the sequence in which they are traversed in the tree. The resulting output displays Huffman codes of every character indicating the optimization of encoding according to the frequency of characters.
